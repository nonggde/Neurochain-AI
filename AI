NeuroChain AI: A Decentralized Intelligent Blockchain Network

Overview

NeuroChain AI is a decentralized intelligent platform that combines blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). It focuses on privacy-preserving collaborative learning, quantum resistance, and scalable computation. The project is launched on the pump.fun platform, making it accessible for anyone to explore, test, and develop new AI-driven applications.

Key Features

	1.	Decentralized AI Collaboration:
Implements federated learning on the blockchain, enabling nodes to collaboratively train AI models while preserving data privacy.
	2.	Quantum-Resistant Security:
Integrates lattice-based cryptography to secure the network against quantum computing threats.
	3.	Scalable Computation:
Leverages a mainchain and sidechain architecture to support efficient AI model computation and data storage.
	4.	Plug-and-Play AI Training:
Developers can easily connect to NeuroChain AI, upload their models, or utilize existing resources for optimization and training.

Project Status

The NeuroChain AI token has been successfully launched via the pump.fun platform. Developers and users can obtain tokens to support computation or test the network.

Quick Start

Here’s how to set up and test the NeuroChain AI network locally:

Prerequisites

	•	Install Node.js (v16+)
	•	Install Python 3.8+ (for AI model training)

Installation

	1.	Clone the project repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/NeuroChain-AI.git
cd NeuroChain-AI


	2.	Install dependencies:

npm install # Blockchain-related dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt # AI model-related dependencies


	3.	Start a local blockchain node:

npm run start


	4.	Train a sample AI model:

python train_model.py

Example: Training an AI Model on NeuroChain AI

Python (train_model.py)

from neurochain import FederatedLearningNode, Blockchain

# Initialize a federated learning node
node = FederatedLearningNode(node_id="node-1", blockchain=Blockchain())

# Load sample data
data = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
labels = [0, 1, 1]

# Define a simple training task
def train_model(data, labels):
    weights = sum([x[0] * label for x, label in zip(data, labels)]) / len(data)
    return {"weights": weights}

# Train the model
model_params = train_model(data, labels)
print(f"Trained Model Parameters: {model_params}")

# Upload the model parameters to the blockchain
node.upload_model_params(model_params)
print("Model parameters uploaded to the NeuroChain!")

JavaScript (Blockchain Node)

const { Blockchain } = require('./blockchain');

// Initialize a blockchain instance
const blockchain = new Blockchain();

// Add a sample transaction
blockchain.addTransaction({
  from: "node-1",
  to: "global_model",
  params: { weights: 0.85 },
});

// Print the current state of the blockchain
console.log("Current Blockchain State:");
console.log(blockchain.chain);
